            <p> This algorithm looks into 14 different lung diseases and evaluates the likelihood for each category based on the input image. The three most likely categories are <b> {{largest_three_cat[2]}}</b>, <b>{{largest_three_cat[1]}}</b> and <b>{{largest_three_cat[0]}}</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
             Besides, an image of localization is also generated to reflect the likely pathology area for {{largest_three_cat[2]}}, the disease with the highest probability.
            </p>
            <p  class = 'mb-5'>The bar chart gives the probability for each category, and as a rule of thumb, if none of these probabilities goes beyond 0.5, we consider this as a normal case. Or, a patient with  multiple significant labels is also not uncommon.
